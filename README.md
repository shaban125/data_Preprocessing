# Data Preprocessing App

This Flask-based web application performs basic data preprocessing tasks on uploaded CSV files. It allows users to handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize data, and visualize data.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Upload a CSV file to preprocess.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Detect and handle missing data.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identify and remove duplicate rows.
- **Data Normalization**: Scale or normalize data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps for better data understanding.

## Libraries Used
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- **Numpy**: To handle numerical operations and data structures.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating plots and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization and statistical graphics.

## How It Works
1. Users upload a CSV file through the web interface.
2. The app processes the file based on the selected preprocessing tasks.
3. Visualizations are generated for analysis, and the cleaned dataset is available for download.
